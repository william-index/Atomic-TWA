# Atomic-TWA theme

Atomic-TWA is a theme for Atom, Github's text editor. Its inspired by the original Mac Classic theme for TextMate, but with heavy modifications.
Over the years I have adapted a certain color palette to all my environments that focuses on readability, and the ability to quickly distinguish elements, especially when embedding scripts, php and other resources.

### TL;DR

Theme for front-end web + php devs. Focus is on focus and ease of readings/distinguishing content. Highlights embeded code sections, and selection of copy is visible even over highlights.
